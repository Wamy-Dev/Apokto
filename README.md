# Apokto
Adding all your favorite repos is hard, there are tweaks like [Flame](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.aditkamath.flame/) that are able to batch add repos from your clipboard, but I don't think this is good enough. So instead, I am making Apokto, an iOS jailbreak repo, that allows you to customize and make a list of all other repos available, and creates for you a custom repo list that is easily installed by your favorite jailbreak package manager. The only repo you will ever need to manually add when on jailbreak! This is also inspired by the [Carcaschoi Switch Shop Forwarder](https://github.com/carcaschoi/tinfoil-json). Instead of being used for switch repos, this is used for any jailbreak device on any iOS.

# Piracy

Usually, I am a pirate friendly developer but this is a project where piracy will not be allowed. Jailbreak package developers work very hard on their projects and I don't want to hurt them in anyway. [Parcility.co](https://parcility.co/), where all the repositories essentially come from, also does not condone piracy in their repo lists, so I made it easy on myself and just not allowed it on this repo.

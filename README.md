# Apokto
This is a IOS jailbreak repo, that allows you to customize and make a list of all other repos available, and creates for you a custom repo list that is easily installed by your favorite jailbreak package manager. The only repo you will ever need to manually add when on jailbreak!

This is based on the [Carcaschoi Switch Shop Forwarder](https://github.com/carcaschoi/tinfoil-json). Instead of being used for switch repos, this is used for any jailbreak device on any IOS.
